## Indian Semi Acted Facial Expression Database (iSAFE)

ISAFE is one of it's kind database for human emotions. 

Human emotion recognition is of par importance for human computer interaction. Dataset and it's quality plays important role in this domain. In this paper we propose a new dataset which contains **395 clips of 44 volunteers** between 17 to 22 year of age. All the clips are manually splitted from the video recorded during stimulent clips are watched by volunteers. Facial expressions are self annotated by the volunteers as well as cross annotated by annotators. Analysis of the dataset is done using Resnet34 neural network and baseline for the dataset is provided for research and comparison.
